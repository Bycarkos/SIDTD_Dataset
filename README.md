# About the project

The purpose of this project is to generate a new data partition to recognize DNI without the need to use completely real data. To achieve this, different databases have been modified. In addition to these modifications, a database of its own has been created as a result of varying and changing the structure of the images that are in it.

## Structure

The structure of the project is decripted as follows:
```
SIDTD
│   LICENSE
│   setup.py
|   requirements.txt   
│
└───Fake_Generator
|   |
│   └───Fake_Loader 
│   |
|   |
|   |___Test_Examples
|       
└───Loader
|
|___code_examples
|
|___models
```


All the names in this structure are folders. Every folder have his own Readme to make clearer all the structure.

In the *Fake_Generator* folder are the scripts to create your own dataset with different variability

In the *Loader* folder are the main functionalities to download the benchmark  that we used to train the models. Furthermore you can download the different datasets that we used to train and pretrain the models.

In the *code examples* folder are 4 different scripts that reproduce some functionalities that we have done in order to create the datasetm train and test the different models. Are scripts to run localy.

Finally in the models' folder ##TODO Maxime.


## Instalation

To get the Dataloader package you will need to:

```bash
    pip install git+https://github.com/Oriolrt/SIDTD_Dataset.git
```

Enter to any python terminal and now you can
```bash
  import Loader
```
It shouldnt exist any type of error
